- What would you do differently?
I would analyze an online news popularity data set and predict **shares** variable by backward linear regression and random forest. Firstly I read it into R session and determine which variables that I would deal with.  

- What was the most difficult part for you?
The most difficult part for me is automation, I do the automation at the end, then all variables related to Monday need to be changed, and creating a similar document for all weekdays is also hard for me, I follow the method on the notes but it didn't work for me, then I solved the problem by someone's post on discussion board.  

- What are your big take-aways from this project?
My take-aways from this project is that I learned to knit with parameters and automatically create files with different parameters.
