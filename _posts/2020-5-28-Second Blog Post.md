- What are your thoughts on R vs whatever other software you've used?  
For me, r is easier to get started, because r does not have a very complicated syntax, and users can clearly understand the meaning of the code.  

- What functionality do you like about R?  
My favorite function is rmarkdown, it can knit the R code with output into PDF/HTML/Word, etc form, turn my analyses into high quality documents, reports, presentations and dashboards, which is easy to read.  

- What parts do you miss about your other language?  
Python can do things like writing applications for Windows, but R can't.  
When I have a typo of code, SAS may notice me and it knows what I actually want to do, but R can't.  

- Do you consider R a difficult language to learn? (If you knew R prior to the course, describe your experience when first learning it.)  
I don't think R is a difficult language to learn, my first experience with R was when I was an undergraduate, the TA introduced four main 'areas' of R and then introduced some basic function/operations, naturally, I got started easily. The whole learning process is very smooth, even if I have encountered some difficulties in it.
