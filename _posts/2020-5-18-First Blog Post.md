What do you think being a data scientist is about?  

What do you see as the major duties and/or knowledge areas?  

What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians?  
Differences: Statisticians need to understand the modeling and structure of data, while data scientists need to understand applied statistics. Their means of data collection are quite different, on one hand, the amount of data for data scientists is often massive, consequently, they spend a lot of time with tasks like large-scale data ingest, data cleansing and transformation. Conversely, statisticians still rely on more traditional and smaller scale methods of data collection, such as surveys, polls, and experiments. Data scientists focus on comparing a number of different methods to create the best machine learning model, statisticians work to improve a single, simple model to best fit the data, and statisticians tend to focus more on quantifying uncertainty than data scientists.
Similarities: Both of them need a solid foundation in statistics.

How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?
