- What (if anything) has changed about what you think a data scientist is and what they do?  
Data scientists are big data wranglers, gathering and analyzing large sets of structured and unstructured data. They analyze, process, and model data then interpret the results to create actionable plans for companies and other organizations.  

- What your current thoughts are in terms of using R for data science - do you think you'll continue to use R going forward?  Why or why not?  
For data science, I think R is a foundational tool to manipulate data sets, and create visualizations to communicate results. I'll continue to use R definitely because I can use R for statistical analysis, data visualization, and predictive modeling.  

- What things are you going to do differently in practice now that you've had this course?  
Now I know how to read in raw data, manipulate to a nice form, choose the best fit model, make predictions, analyze and visualize data, report my results with a shiny app.
