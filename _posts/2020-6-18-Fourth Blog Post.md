- How is the course going so far?  
I felt good from module 1 to exam 1, but I felt so lost after I watched the video of module 8, I felt that the course content suddenly becomes difficult, especially the last two videos of module 8, and I saw that there are much more videos to watch from module 9, so many assignments need to do, the time is extremely tight for me.  

- What do you like about the course and what would you change about the course?  
I like the content of this course, this course starts with the most basic introduction to R, which is very friendly to beginners, making me confident in learning R, since the beginning of this course is very simple, I think the course schedule can be more reasonable, compress simple content together and push forward, in this way, the difficult content in the second half of the course will not make me feel so stressed and lost, this may also be because the time of the summer class is relatively tight, if the schedule is used in the spring or fall semester, and there is only one homework per week, I think the problem will not exist.  

- Any other thoughts?  (I just like to hear how everyone is doing and get feedback to incorporate!)  
In general, I really like this course. This is my second time to take the class of Professor Post. Your teaching is very clear, careful, detailed, and logical, making me feel that I'm really following you step by step to learn.
