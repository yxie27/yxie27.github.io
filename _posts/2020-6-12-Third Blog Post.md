- What would you do differently?  
At the very beginning, I upload my file manually in Github, then I push myself to try terminal parse the NHL JSON data to some graphs and text.  

- What was the most difficult part for you?  
The most difficult part for me is to connect repo to my RStudio. I looked the video on the web, follow the step, since I don't know anything about the operation of the terminal before, it makes me so confused and upset, finally, I find an easy way to connect my repo to RStudio by creating a project in RStudio and set up the version control, clicking Git, filling out some simple things like repo URL. Besides that, I failed to commit and push my changes, it shows that I have some errors, but I don't understand the message that comes after I click push, so I recreate a project, connect to my repo, copy and paste my code to my new file, commit and push my changes, and then it works. :)  

- What are your big take-aways from this project?  
My take-aways from this project is that I learned to connect repo to RStudio, it's a particularly convenient way to upload my changes to remote, wherever I am, and I think this can also be used well on group projects in the future, different people can upload their changes to the same place, and can also view historical changes.
